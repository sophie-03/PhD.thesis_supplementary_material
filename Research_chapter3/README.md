# Supplementary tables for research chapter 3

**Supplementary table 1.** Results of a genome-wide PGLS analysis for association between relative dN (the gene-specific dN divided by the mean dN across all genes for that branch) and longevity (adjusted p-value < 0.05).

**Supplementary table 2.** Results of a genome-wide PGLS analysis for association between relative dN (the gene-specific dN divided by the mean dN across all genes for that branch) and body size (adjusted p-value < 0.05).
